\title{Combines two dartR genlight objects}
\usage{
gl.join(x1, x2, method = NULL, verbose = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x1}{Name of the first genlight object [required].}

\item{x2}{Name of the second genlight object [required].}

\item{method}{Legacy parameter, issue warning [default NULL]}

\item{verbose}{Verbosity: 0, silent or fatal errors; 1, begin and end; 2,
progress log; 3, progress and results summary; 5, full report
[default 2 or as specified using gl.set.verbosity].}
}
\value{
A new genlight object
}
\description{
This function combines two genlight objects and their associated metadata.
The history associated with the two genlight objects is cleared from the new
genlight object. Either the individuals/samples must be the same in each genlight
object, in which case the new genlight object has the same individuals but combined loci,
or the number of loci must be the same in each genlight object in which case the new
genlight object has the same loci but combined individuals/samples.
The function is typically used to combine datasets from the same service
where the files have been split because of size limitations. The data is read
in from multiple csv files, then the resultant genlight objects are combined.
This function works with both SNP and Tag P/A data.
}
\details{
This script joins two genlight objects together along with the associated metadata. if method='sidebyside' (the default), the individuals 
in the two genlight objects must be the same and in the same order. The loci are combined.

If method='end2end', the loci in the two genlight objects must be the same and in the same order. The data for the two sets of individuals
are combined. Note that if two individuals have the same names, they will be made unique.#'
